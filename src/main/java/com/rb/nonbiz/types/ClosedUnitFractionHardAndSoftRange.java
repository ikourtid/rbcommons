  /**
   * Returns a {@link ClosedUnitFractionRange} using the following rules:
   *
   * If the point is outside the hard range, then return the soft range.
   * If the point is within the soft range, then return the soft range.
   * If the point is between the soft and hard range, return the soft range expanded to include the point.
   *
   * The business case is the following. Assume a soft range of [14%, 26%] and a hard range of [10%, 30%].
   *
   * If the current position is e.g. 32%, we want to sell it all the way to 26%, not to 30%.
   *
   * - if the current position is too high, and above the hard limit (e.g. 35%), then we want to sell it down to be
   *   within the soft range, so no more than 26%. The reason why we don't sell just to within the hard range
   *   (i.e. down to 30%) is that, if we were to do that, then the next time we consider trading, this position could go
   *   above 30% due to market drift, even if we don't trade, and we wouldn't want to sell yet again.
   *   In other words, we want to slightly over-shoot the hard limit,
   *   so we wonâ€™t have to immediately trade again due to price fluctuations.
   * - if the current position is within the soft range (e.g. 22%), then we will return the soft range. We don't want
   *   it to go above 26%, so we'll use that as a max since the returned range will be [14%, 26%].
   * - if the current position is outside the soft range BUT within the hard range (e.g. 27%), then we don't want to
   *   buy more and increase it, but we don't necessarily want to sell.
   *
   * The above discussion is for cases where pointToInclude is above the upper bounds of one or both of the ranges,
   * but the same applies (symmetrically) for the case where pointToInclude is below the lower bound.
   *
   * In that case, effectively the semantics are
   * "sell a lot if very misallocated; do not buy more if somewhat overweight; buy up to soft max otherwise".
   *
   * This may make more sense in the tests.

/**
 * A typesafe representation of an angle.

 * <p> This breaks the convention of dumb immutable classes, but is handy because it lazy-evaluates cosine (from degrees)
 * or degrees (from cosine). These conversions are heavy operation, so it's good to avoid when possible. </p>
 *
 * <p> Also, depending on how you view it, this is still immutable, because once the calculation happens,
 * it won't happen again. It's not like there is some field that can be modified with a setter. </p>
 *
 * <p> {@link PreciseValue} also follows this pattern for supporting both a BigDecimal and a double version. </p>
